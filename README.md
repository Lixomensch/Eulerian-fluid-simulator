# Eulerian Fluid Simulator

The Eulerian Fluid Simulator is a software project designed to simulate fluid behavior using the Eulerian method. Developed for educational purposes, this simulator uses Visual Studio for compilation and executable generation, and SFML for graphical rendering, providing an interactive and intuitive visualization of simulation results.

## Technologies Used

- **Visual Studio**: Integrated development environment (IDE) used for programming and debugging the Eulerian simulator. It offers powerful tools for C++ application development and seamless integration with libraries such as SFML.

- **SFML**: Utilized for graphical rendering and user interaction, offering a user-friendly and responsive interface for visualizing simulation results.

- **C++**: Primary programming language for implementing the simulator, providing performance and direct control over intensive computational operations.
